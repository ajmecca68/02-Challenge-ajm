# This is an internet marketing site that was refactored for accessibility.

## What was refactored
* **Semantic Elements**: I replaced the div elements with semantic elements throughout the html
* **alt descriptions**: I added alt descriptions to all images and icons
* **Title**: I changed the title from "website" to the company name
* **Sticky Header**: I decided to make the header "sticky". 
* **Consolidated Classes**: I consolidated classes in lines 93-106 and 118-127.  I also adjusted the hero image so it was better aspect ratio.
